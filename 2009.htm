But I at least tried it! In my defense, I was using L's watercolor set on plain/flimsy printer paper so the odds were stacked against me!",

This is of course unusable but I have to say I really like the feel of this - even though it was just a 20-minute fling.",

Trivia: Initially the cart was going to be a warm pretzel and hot dog stand but in the end I figured hot chocolate and cookies seemed much more C's style :)",

I liked this idea and layout but a.) I wanted C to get more attention in this one this time and b.) I was scared some people might think the train was about to hit the kids!",
"http://chrisemerson.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/sketch_01.gif;http://chrisemerson.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/sketch_01.gif?thumbnail;Final Sketch (2);Final sketch before moving to Photoshop. Big shock that I snuck a polar bear in at this point! I was sad I couldn't sneak in the drink sizes shown here in the final card but there was just no room w/out forcing it so I had to leave it out.",

I eventually deleted all lines and I definitely liked the look better w/out lines - so I think that will be the style from now on."
