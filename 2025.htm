    <p>As always I was pretty unsure if I'd pull off a card this year but I guess I did it one more time. I tried a somewhat different art style as well - TBH I don't love it but the line/cartoon style I typically use didn't feel like a match for the vibe I was going for so I forced myself to resist reverting to it. But for the record I do not fancy myself a professional painter of something ... the iPad just let's you pretend you are. Also I do realize this isn't really a very "Christmasy" scene/concept but my other idea felt too ambitious (maybe next year) and also I just went it vs over-thinking how to force Christmas imagery in here.</p>

    <p><i>On a technical note - I finally closed my old chris-emerson.com website domain/server this year (mainly for $) so this site is being moved to a github page which hopefully will work w/out too many complications.</i> Also this year's card "folding" is very poorly done. I normally score them myself but splurged a few extra cents to have the printer do it for me ... but the cards look like a 2nd grader folded them with a rock - so my apologies for that, lesson learned.</p>

    <p>Shout out to everyone still on my Christmas card list ... it's very short but so is my list of people I admire and appreciate these days ;)</p>
