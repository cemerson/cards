    <p>I still don't know if it's "acceptable" to come up with imagined scenes from Jesus' childhood but for what it's worth   
    my only intention is to A) keep the focus of Christmas on Christ and B) to remind others (and myself) that He was a real   
     human, a real child, etc. Also, for the record, I do realize this scene isn't <i>really</i> very Christmas-related but <i>technically</i> this   
    scene could have happened on December 25 since I have snow in there (<i>... even though I believe snow is rare in that region   
    of the world</i>).      
    <br/><br/> 
    I'm not sure when the idea came to me but was likely waiting in my subconscious thanks to  
    <a href='https://odysee.com/@ChristianSermonArchive:3/Jesus-And-Mary-(Passion-Of-The-Christ):1' target='_blank'>this great scene</a>   
    from The Passion of the Christ movie.
    Hopefully the hammer and nails imagery isn't too obvious but that is my attempt at a foreshadowing element. 
    Initially I wasn't going to have any head covering on Jesus but after some basic research I felt like it would probably be more normal   
    for him to be wearing something - even though I let His hair down the side of it ... which of course complete negates the purpose   
    of the head covering ... I guess chalk it up to artistic license or something. Funny side note before I added the lamb I almost used   
     some random Middle East rodent called a '<a href=\"https://www.israel-in-photos.com/rock-hyrax.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hyrax</a>'   
    or something ... but obviously a sheep made way more sense.  Also if you watch the time lapse (below) you'll see I struggled a bit   
    w/the body positions. Hopefully the final product is close enough but props to the better artists than me out   
    there who can whip up a perfect human form in any given position at the drop of a hat - <i>that</i> is real skill IMO.</p>

    <b>A few notes about the print version of the card:</b>
    <li style='color:#ffe668;font-size:100%;'>To anyone who got a card the last few years and did not this year - there were various cost and logistic challenges this year with printing so I had to make some cuts. My apologies for this :(</li>
    <li style='color:#ffe668;font-size:100%;'>For the people who DID get a print card ... there were 3 variations of the print quality. My apologies to anyone who got a version w/color streaking in the print out - I was/am of course horrified I had to use those but I had no choice - plus I'm guessing some people, no offense, won't even notice because you have healthy brains and don't obsess of things like that.</li>
    <li style='color:#ffe668;font-size:100%;'>The best possible print quality this year came from me printing the card basically like a photo on literal photo paper - so if your print is a bit flimsy (<i>or looks like I used a glue stick and a cutting board</i>) consider yourself ... lucky?</li>    
    </ul>
