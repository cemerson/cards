    "have to suffer through the weeks of sketching trying to come up with an idea. Around the halfway point I realized that it's not entirely obvious if my wife and I are just arriving or about to leave but I didn't have the time to rework everything to deal with that - so if that throws you off my apologies! Another thing I thought was funny was the way the car I gave us turned out - it ended up looking like some European car from the 70s ... pretty funny. I think that looks more interesting than either of our actual cars anyhow!</p>" +
    "<p>Make sure to notice the sharpie pen in Bear's hand - I'm worried it's far too subtle so most may miss it. I did that just so C could have something to yell at Miss Bear about again :).</p>" +
    "<p>Artwork created with <a href='http://savage.si/' target='_blank'>Procreate</a> iPad app. As has happened with past cards the overall dark colors of this card turned out to be difficult to print out - but rather than lose the original level of brightness/contrast I decided to have the prints stay pretty dark. This means you'll need to view the paper version by a good light source to really see it well ... or just go online to see it in it's original form! Someone remind me to stick with ligher color/contrast scenes from now on!</p>" +
    "<p>This year's card is dedicated to Nathan and Darren. Both were better men than me and I miss them both.";
