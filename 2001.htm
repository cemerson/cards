									"was ok for being small.  It has a nice &quot;enchanting trot with a polar bear at arctic dusk&quot; feel to it. </p>" +
									"<p>The idea for the main illustration came from one of the pre-card sketches.  I was hoping to get some " +
									"wind and blizzard gusts in the final card, but I didn't have enough time to get that effect looking like I wanted. Sometimes I like the pre-sketches " +
