    var cardNotes = "<p>I had a(nother) tough time coming up w/an idea for a card this year. Finally in early December I sketched out a doodle that seemed " +
									"semi-interesting. After trying desperately to get the computer version to feel/look more like the main sketch, I finally gave in to the fact that the computer version would" +
									"just be it's own unique version - it eventually came out ok I suppose. I had hoped to use the &quot;Polar Bean Coffee&quot; logo/idea more than I did - but I couldn't seem to squeeze it in really anywhere special...</p>" +
									"<p>Originally the back illustration (<i>everyone at the coffee bar</i>) was going to be on the <u>front</u> of the card - and the back would " +
									"be an empty coffee bar with everyone playing outside. But after I decided to put the nativity scene on the coffee bar counter, AND after trying to " +
									"figure out what words to use on the card this year (<i>&quot;Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year&quot;</i>), it only made sense to swap the images and put" +
									"the nativity scene on the front. Because after all, no matter what tv commercials and movies try to say, that is what Christmas is all about... right? :)</p>";
