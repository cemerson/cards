    "<p>You can probably tell from the sketches image below that my card ideas were kind of all over the place this year. I was kind of warming up to the WWII one but I over-analyzed it in my head so I gave up on that and went a different direction. I did seriously consider setting the city on fire (in the image, not IRL) but didn't want to make the card too black pill so I left it alone. Though I may make a 2nd, darker version of the same scene anyhow just for me if I can't shake the idea.<br/><br/>Once again I used the old faithful Procreate iPad app to paint this one. I had to get my iPad Pro battery replaced this year but I don't know how much longer it will last - hopefully a while. It's been a good run in any case. </p>" + 
    
    "<p>This year's card is dedicated to my Dad (1947-2015). I should have done this a couple years ago  but none of the cards since 2016 have been good enough IMO (even though I'm sure he'd have liked them all) but I think he would have especially liked this one (<i>anything w/the US Flag</i>).</p>" +

The first one was was in 1998 and somehow I've managed to get one done every year since then ... pretty crazy. How time flies. By the way please note that there is now a dropdown menu in the title year above to it easier/faster to navigate to different card years.</p>";
