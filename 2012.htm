    var cardNotes = "<p>This year's Christmas card came together fairly well I think. I still have to say the whole process still feels far too digital/mechanical and not nearly artistic enough to me. Maybe one day there will be a way for me to make these with software or a device that feels as organic as markers and a pencil  ... until then these always feel like a human-generated pencil sketch that I paint-by-numbers-with-a-computer on top of. But I digress ... </p>" +
  "<p>No real shockers on the content side - my kids continue to be my best/favorite material to pull from. I may have made C look a bit younger than she looks in real life now but hey  ... a Dad can pretend right? Of course neither of them are even remotely accurate portraits - but hopefully I got their height and clothes close (?).</p>" +
  "<p>On the technology end of things - continuing with last year's approach I used my iPad to do the painting. I used two separate apps this time though: Brushes 3 and Procreate. Both apps were able to create a decently large canvas for HQ printing - and I would have used Brushes for the whole thing but I didn't realize till around 80% that it didn't have a 'smudge' or 'blur' brush - so that's why I finished the card with Procreate. Honestly the quality of the cards I printed on paper for snail-mail wasn't clear/crisp as I would have liked it - I'm not sure whether that's because my paint style didn't use hard-edged lines or if the resolution/DPI of these iPad apps is just not fine enough yet.</p>" +
