    "<p>As you can see from some of the sketches the stack of ideas for this year's card was a bit slow-going. I seriously considered the <a rel='colorbox' href='https://farm1.staticflickr.com/733/23204560734_6879172f6b_b.jpg'>one with the nativity figurines next to the cocktail on the rocks or the animal at a table across from an empty chair</a> but, as usual, I chickened out of going with something less-cheery and stuck with something more upbeat/christmasy yadda yadda.</p>" + 
    "<p>Everyone who got a printed card in the mail please note that the cropping of the <a rel='colorbox' href='https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/728/23824833675_5b6a60d9f7_b.jpg'>printed version</a> does NOT match the <a rel='colorbox' href='https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5644/23456889479_be677a316a_h.jpg'>original, digital version</a> but by time I realized that it was too late. While I'm being whiny I do have to say my personal deskjet still blows the pants off the quality of the print vendor I used (again) this year - although the vendor costs less than buying my own ink. I MAY consider going back to home-printing next year... we'll see.</p>" +
