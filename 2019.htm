    "<p>I've been fascinated with WWI and WWII for quite a while so it was only a matter of time until I found a chance to try " + 
    "making one of my Christmas cards focused on one of them. Both topics are obviously huge so I won't try to convey all my " + 
    "feelings about them here. However I will say that both wars were two of the darkest moments of human history " + 
    "and the loss of life across them both is staggaring and heart-breaking. It is beyond tragic that generations of strong men and familes were devoured by two needless wars and I do (often) wonder if Western civilization will ever recover from what we lost in them. </p>" + 
    "<p>As for the card illustration, it is of course based on the famous 'Christmas Truce of 1914' where an informal truce was called at different sections " +
    "of trench lines and British, Germans and others put down their guns and mingled in no man's land. For anyone who has never heard of this event here " +
    " are a couple links to check out: <a href='https://www.history.com/news/world-war-is-christmas-truce-100-years-ago' target='_blank'>link1</a>, " +

    "and <a href='https://allthatsinteresting.com/christmas-truce-of-1914' target='_blank'>link3</a>. I found the following poem about the truce while making the card and loved it so much I put it on the back of this year's card:" +
    "<p><blockquote style='font-family: monospace;font-size: 18px;line-height: 22px;font-weight: normal;color: #333;background-color: #eee;border-radius: 3px;padding: 25px 0px 40px;box-shadow: 0px 3px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);margin-top: -5px;'>" + 
    "<b>The Christmas Truce of 1914</b><br/><small>by Alexander Johnson</small><br/><br/>There was a time among the dead, a corner of some foreign field, <br/>Where legions made and marches led, where Tommys lay and fates were sealed.<br/>That on one cold and bitter day, the time felt right for sweeter things, <br/>Space for a joyous better way, no empires here nor crowns for Kings.<br/>A fleeting warmth on those bleak grounds, gave hope for many saddened souls, <br/>But others cared for empire and crowns, the death knell for those kindly goals.<br/>Hear bells and always think of them, let good folk heed,  evil forget, <br/>Let go of hate,  forgive those men, that left us with such needless debt.<br/>Whether Tommy,  Fritz or Average Joe, we were united on that special field, <br/>That Christmas eve so long ago, when wounds and broken hearts were healed." + 
    "</blockquote>" + 
    "<p>This year's card is dedicated the 20 million soldiers who died in WW1. Rest in peace and forgive us for letting Western civilization devolve to the point it's gotten to now.</p>" + 
    "<p>See below for sketches, related photos, time lapse videos, etc. Also on a related note, I am trying a new service that let's me upload artwork for custom size printing (posters, etc) so if anyone besides me ever wants to print this or some of my other artwork you can do it <a href='https://www.redbubble.com/people/emersondesign/works/42926219-the-christmas-truce-of-1914?asc=u&ref=recent-owner' target='_new'>here</a>.</p>";
