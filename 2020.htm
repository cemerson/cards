And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. <br/><br/>For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord." +

    "<p>My initial idea this year was to create an image of the Pilgrims during Christmas ... but after researching the topic <a href='https://www.plymouth400inc.org/did-the-pilgrims-celebrate-christmas/' target='_blank'>I found out</a> they didn't even celebrate Christmas (which is kind of cool) ... so there went that idea! Then I went into researching where the Christmas tree came from. That was also fascinating (see <a href='https://www.catholic.com/magazine/online-edition/st-boniface-and-the-christmas-tree' target='_blank'>Saint Boniface</a>, <a href='https://www.traditioninaction.org/religious/f031_Tree.htm' target='_blank'>Paradise Play/Germans</a>) - but no card image ideas came from that.</p>" + 
    "<p>After researching a few other topics I eventually got interested in doing my own version of the popular 'angels and shepherds' scene from the New Testament's record of the birth of Jesus. On this note an interesting, additional trivia topic is what researchers think the 'star of Bethlehem' was. No one truly knows but some believe it may have been an <a href='https://www.joydigitalmag.com/burning-issues/the-star-of-bethlehem/' target='_blank'>exploding star (super nova)</a> which is pretty cool.</p>" +

Contrary to common belief Jesus was born in more of a separate section of someone's house area than a 'barn with animals'.",

Some very interesting stories here from first origination from a prop from a medeival play about the Garden of Eden, to a legend of a Catholic priest chopping down a pagan oak tree, to, the more likely, general, Christian 'festive' symbol from 1500's Germany that was brought to America by German settlers in Pennsylvania.",

The middle/left was a series of 4 vertical images of close-ups of Jesus' hand/arm throughout his life - but it didn't have enough of a Christmas/birth focus so I didn't go with that.",

As mentioned I think the position of the people and the coloring had a much stronger sense of fear which I liked. My apologies that I lost that in the final card. If I had more time I'd have likely reworked it to get this vibe back into the image.",
