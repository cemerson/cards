									"in love with - so it took a while for an idea to come together. There *is* a subtle/underlying meaning to the card this year - only certain will will know what it" +
									"is though... :)</p>" +
									"<p>This year also took more &quot;sketches&quot; than I've ever had to do - the idea was really hard to narrow down to a couple &quot;scenes&quot; but I think things came " +
									"together ok in the end. I still like last year's card better than this one though - I <i>think</i> that's because of the &quot;indoor&quot; scene/feel of last year's card - there's " +
									"something more interesting/fun about 'indoor' scenes - something about having snow outside, but being inside where it's warm - I think next year I may do another" +
									"indoor scene because of that... if I have time! :)</p>";
