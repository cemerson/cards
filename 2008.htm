								    "<p>Well it's no secret this year's card is about the kids! They're my best material to work with now and I have to admit I've always wanted to draw a train in a snowy/mountain setting. There's not really any symbolism/layered meaning here - it's just a fun scene of the kids having an winter adventure! Although - there is a chance that the walrus guy was a subliminal nod to <a href='http://www.wowwiki.com/Tuskarr' target='wownew'>WoW:WoTLK</a>! :)</p>" +
								    "<p>This card took around 25 hours to make in the end (broken up into 10 or so 2 hour sessions). Thanks to my wife and the kids for letting me stay in the attic a few extra hours on the past few weekends to get this done! I hope you guys like it!</p>" +
								    "<p>Make sure to check out the sketches/etc this year. One of the sketches even has some contributions from one of the kids (see Sketches 1/6). Merry Christmas everyone!</p>";
