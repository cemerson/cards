    var cardNotes = "<p>Another card completed! As usual, I was a bit nervous this year if I'd be able to get a card done in time - but with my wife's help I was able to get it done and have them printed by December 16th (talk about cutting it close).</p>" +
									"<p>The big news w/this card is that it was printed on a brand new printer! The past 4 or 5 cards were all printed on an old HP Deskjet 882c. Well, that printer died early this year, so I had to get a new one. Amazingly, it only cost ~$70 and it prints WAY better than the old one! The colors never match up to what I see on-screen but I think that's just because I've never figured out how to setup my Photoshop color/monitor profiles or something.</p>" +
									"<p>I also had to drop a few people from the recipient list this year for the sake of time and other tactical reasons. My apologies to all who got dropped. :(" +
									"<p>And of course this is the 3rd card all about L :). I tried hard to think of some kind of story/drama to center this year's card around but I couldn't come up w/anything super interesting. In the end, I figured since he will be showered in toys this Christmas I should show him *giving* someone else a present - if nothing else for my own sanity. Thanks again to my wife (and L) who had extra patience w/me this year as I scrambled to get it done.</p>";
