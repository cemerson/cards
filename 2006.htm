										"my original idea was more of a fireplace scene with L in a neat 'bear' suit but the problem with that scene was that wasn't any kind of action/story element to it," +
										"so I evolved the concept in Photoshop just a tad :). <br>I also was hopeful at first that I'd be able to use a new program called &quot;Corel Painter IX&quot;" +
										"to do this year's card because it's an interesting/fresh way to draw/paint on the computer for me, but I just didn't have enough time to give that a full try this year - maybe next year!</p>" +
										"<p>Thanks again to my wife and L for giving me extra free-time to do this year's card, AND for their help printing the envelopes, buying the shiny card paper @ OfficeDepot and most of all giving me a reason to draw a card in the 1st place :)";
