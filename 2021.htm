    "<p>I gave myself a higher chance than normal that I would finally *NOT* be able to do a card this year (for lack of ideas and/or complications/time constraints of real life) ... but I guess my pessimism was premature again. As everyone (w/a brain) knows this year has been pretty brutal on many fronts mentally thanks to the geniuses (idiots) running (ruining) our country right now ... but I tried to keep that out of the card and just focus on the reason for Christmas, etc.</p><p>Initially I was going to do some kind of Christmas scene around General Robert E. Lee given the disgraceful treatment he's been been given increasingly the past few years - but it didn't feel 'Christmas' enough and also felt too politically loaded a topic so I set that aside for a non-holiday graphic another day and I instead landed on an image idea around a young Jesus and Mary which is probably more appropriate/better for multiple reasons.</p><p>Hopefully I'm not breaking some major rule of Christianity by depicting Jesus and Mary in a scene not directly from the Bible. I'm also not entirely sure it snows very much in the locations where Jesus grew up - but the little research I did seems to suggest that the places Jesus grew up do see snow sometimes so I just went w/that. Finally, I'm not sure if I got the word 'Jesus' correctly spelled (in his childhood tongue) in the snow - my apologies if not. Anyhow ... after all those disclaimers I'll just say that I'm well aware that it's very likely this scene never occurred and I'm not saying it did - I just think it's interesting to wonder about what kinds of moments Mary and Jesus (and Joseph) may have had like this when Jesus was growing up.</p>" +
