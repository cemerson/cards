    var cardNotes = "<p>Hopefully the fact that I didn't include the kids in this year's card won't start any riots in the streets - but after doing that for 5 or 6 (?) years it was starting to feel forced so I went back to basics and stuck with just animals this year. As you can see from the sketches I <i>did</i> try to come up with something that included the kids but nothing was grabbing my attention.</p>" + 
    "<p>The actual idea/scene in my mind for this card was a bit more <a href='http://goo.gl/AU1av' target='_blank'>Wes Anderson</a>/<a href='http://goo.gl/UUSnM' target='_blank'>Fantastic Mr. Fox</a> than it actually turned out ... but I still like the end result. They all seem like interesting people who I'd love to meet and chat with in real life. The painting in the back is my subconscious take on something similar we had above our fireplace mantle when I was growing up (<a href='http://goo.gl/elsHde' target='_blank'>actual photo here!</a>). It was of some whaling ship or something and I always thought it was neat. Speaking of subliminal stuff - even though I've used some of these characters before I should probably give homage to an artist I discovered last year who I think is so great and likely played some subconscious role in this year's card. Her name is <a href='http://www.emilywinfieldmartin.com/books.html' target='_blank'>Emily Winfield Martin</a> - definitely check her stuff out ... she is the real deal!</p>" + 
        "<p>This year I tried using a print shop to print the cards instead of printing them all w/my deskjet. The cost savings was great but the quality was not on par with my deskjet. I still used the prints for 90% of the recipients but for a select few I printed a few myself with my deskjet. So if you got one of those you can feel extra special :) ... and if you didn't ... have you seen the price of printer ink these days!? I included a thumbnail below that shows the print vendor's print next to my deskjet print. See if you can tell the difference!</p>"   +
        "<p>Few more technical notes ... this year's card was created entirely on the iPad using my favorite painting app Procreate (same as last year) - although this year I think I was able to create it at twice the 'resolution' (meaning it could probably print twice as large without getting blurry). The actual resolution was 4028 x 2048 pixels ... very cool! By the way - make sure to check out the time lapse video below ... not because my artwork is so awesome - just because it's such a cool feature of the painting app I used! I still find it amazing it can save all the brush strokes from start to finish!</p>" + 
        "<p>Here's hoping everyone reading this has as good a Christmas as these guys here!</p>"
