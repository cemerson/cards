    <p>Continuing the theme of a few past cards I went with another war-related concept this year - this time focusing on the US Civil War. Unlike the <a href="2019.htm" target="_blank">WWI 1917 Truce</a> and <a href="2023.htm" target="_blank">last year's German cabin story</a> - which were both based on true stories - this year's card is a scene that I just dreamed up. It's not impossible that an event like this occurred - since there were documented moments of "truce" between Confederate and Union soldiers from time to time (few links below on this) but for now this one has to be categorized as "aspirational fiction".</p>
    <p>One new component to making this year's card was <a href="https://chatgpt.com/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>. While I, like many, am very suspicious of the unknown implications and unclear future of AI, at the same time it (at least ChatGPT) can be quite helpful in certain situations. In this case it allowed me to get instant feedback on the card concept, provide historical and art-related feedback that came up, find oversights, etc. Normally I don't want to show anyone the card before it's done so I historically have been unable to get anyone's feedback before the cards are printed and mailed out - but thanks to ChatGPT I was able to get some feedback along the way. In some way I view this as a bit "fake" as a purist might say artwork should only come from the artist - mistakes and all. However, the overall process felt about the same as all previous cards so until/unless things start to feel weird I'll likely continue leaning on AI where possible to help speed up and/or refine the final result. That said, it would be hilarious if AI said the idea/image was "amazing!" but everyone else hated it, lol (<i>classic AI fail if so</i>). Another fun bonus of using ChatGTP as a tool here is also getting quick advice and reminders on envelope sizes, best settings for exporting high-quality PDF for the pring shop and other mundate quesitons/tasks. Again, I give it 50/50 odds that  AI will kill 94% of all humanity eventually ... but for now it's disguising itself as quite the handy helper!</p>    
    <p>Anyhow - as for the card concept itself, it's pretty self-explanatory (I hope). In the scene I imagine a gathering of Confederate and Union soldier assembling either before or after one of their battles around Christmas to take time to reflect, etc. My apologies if anything here is a horrible/inaccurate portrayal of anything on either side - my intentions are simply to honor the men on both sides, their humanity and the unfortunate loss of so many lives. </p>

<p>While doing various research around this year's card I found a cool Chritmas poem by an unknown (Anonymous) soldier - snippet below (<a href="https://emergingcivilwar.com/2016/12/17/civil-war-christmas-poetry-soldiers-perspective/" target="_blank">full version here</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
"The wintry blast goes wailing by,<br/>
The snow if falling overhead;<br/>
I hear the lonely sentry's tread,<br/>
And distant watch fires light the sky.<br/>
Dim forms go flitting through the gloom;<br/>
The soldiers cluster round the blaze,<br/>
To talk of other Christmas days,<br/>
And softly speak of [hearth] and home."
<p/><b>- Anonymous</b>

<p>Some final side notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, on a more philisophical/thoughtful note - while trying to repair some of the broken images/links on this site (from flickr/api changes over years) I noticed/remembered how the original card that started this tradition (<a href="1998.htm" target="_blank">Christmas 1998</a>) is a silly, fairly meaningless "cartoon" .. and over time the card concepts/images (<i>at least last few years</i>) are far more serious and/or somber. Weird how your mindset/etc changes over time. Not sure if it means I've become more interesting or just more boring.</li>
<li>Second, my apologies that the digital (web) version of the print is more accurate than the print version. I've yet to find a print shop that nails the color/brightness and/or has competant (and courteous) employees and/or not a gazillion dollars. Here's hoping at least a couple of the print recipients see the digital version at least.</li>
</ul>

<p>This card is especially for my grandfather (on my mother's side) who was a very big fan of Civil War history. I often regret not having the chance to pick his brain on this topic while he was still alive. It's possible he would not like me fictionalizing a scene like this but either way ... here's to him.</a>
