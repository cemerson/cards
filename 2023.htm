    <p>Most people know about the 1917 "Christmas Truce" that I tried to depict <a href="https://cards.chris-emerson.com/2019.htm" target="_blank">a few years ago</a> but I wasn't aware until this year that a similar, and in some ways an even more inspiring, event occurred in 1944 during the Battle of the Bulge so this year's card is my humble attempt at visualizing a moment from that night. Personally I find the story fascinating (partially because my grandfather was in the Battle of the Bulge) so I definitely recommend checking out some of the <a href='#links'>links below</a> - but in short the story is a bittersweet reminder that many of the men on both sides of that war (in many cases just teenagers) were Christian and I'm sure a large percent of them could very easily have been friends with their "enemies" on the other side as they had far more in common with each other than differences.</p>
    <p>By the way I very likely butchered what the original cabin looked like and many other items in the scene - I had to rely on imagination since no photos were taken and very few reference photos were available to pull from - although this <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53401656051_b3195d6d2f_b.jpg" rel="colorbox">Christmas garland from Dresden</a> (screenshot below) I found was pretty cool. Also I realize the included Bible verse excerpt is not exactly being used properly/in context - I've re-used it as it was mentioned in one of the versions of the story.</p>
    <p>Here are some articles I've archived as well as a couple videos that tell the story:

    <b>A few notes about the print version of the card:</b>
    <li style='color:#ffe668;font-size:100%;'>To anyone who got a card the last few years and did not this year - there were various cost and logistic challenges this year with printing so I had to make some cuts. My apologies for this :(</li>
    <li style='color:#ffe668;font-size:100%;'>For the people who DID get a print card ... there were 3 variations of the print quality. My apologies to anyone who got a version w/color streaking in the print out - I was/am of course horrified I had to use those but I had no choice - plus I'm guessing some people, no offense, won't even notice because you have healthy brains and don't obsess of things like that.</li>
    <li style='color:#ffe668;font-size:100%;'>The best possible print quality this year came from me printing the card basically like a photo on literal photo paper - so if your print is a bit flimsy (<i>or looks like I used a glue stick and a cutting board</i>) consider yourself ... lucky?</li>
